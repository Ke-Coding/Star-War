# Star-War

### Introduction
This is a multiplayer game developed by Java, utilizing MVVM design pattern and adhering the dependency-inversion principle. It realizes the high-cohesion and low-coupling.

As [UML-pic](https://github.com/Ke-Coding/Star-War/blob/master/starwarclassrel.cld.jpg) shows the class diagram, each main class has a clear division of labour. To keep the maintainability and extendibility, these main classes interact with each other via the interfaces just a little.
